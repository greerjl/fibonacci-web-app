# Project Checklist

- [x] Implement Fibonacci logic in `python/main.py` or `go/main.go`; handle input validation and edge cases.
- [x] Add supporting modules/configs/scripts to reach "production ready" quality (e.g., dependency management, linters, formatting).
- [x] Document how to run, test, and build the app in `README.md` (or update existing docs).
- [x] Add automated tests for Fibonacci correctness and HTTP responses; include a quick verification command.
- [x] Add CI workflow or local script to run tests/lint/format for change safety.
- [x] Provide a containerization path (Dockerfile review/update) and note deployment instructions for common targets (e.g., k8s, cloud run).
- [x] Consider scalability: stateless service, concurrency-safety, caching if needed, and resource limits.
- [x] Add basic observability: health endpoint/readiness, logging, and minimal metrics/tracing hooks or notes.
- [x] Describe incident response basics: how to detect failures (monitoring/alerts) and steps to recover/redeploy.
- [x] Package project as a git repo and prepare submission (tarball/zip or repo invite) within 24 hours.
